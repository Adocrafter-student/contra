# Assignment 2: Introduction & Literature Review

## Introduction

In today’s markets, unpredictable social and behavioral events going from viral tweets to scandalous headlines can disrupt stock prices in ways traditional trading models and algorithms struggle to anticipate. The goal of this research and project CONTRA is to address the mentioned market gap in the trading world. By proposing a question of why most of the current trading algorithms focus only on the financial indicators of the historical price pattern, they overlook the humans and social factors in their judgment. For example, by looking at the real-world example about Tesla’s stock famously crashing for around 6% in a single day after CEO Elon Musk smoked marijuana during a live podcast [1]. In a similar manner Musk’s casual Twitter post that “Tesla stock price is too high” instantly erased almost $13 billion of the company’s market value (10$ price plunge) [2]. Corporate leadership scandals are also quite damaging since studies have found when CEO’s misconduct becomes public (whether financial fraud or a personal scandal like an affair), shares plummet in between 6% and 9% within a month, costing shareholders about $1.9 billion on average [3].

Traditional financial theory often assumes markets rationally price in all information, but these examples suggest otherwise. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that asset prices “reflect all available information”, implying it is virtually impossible to consistently achieve excess returns (alpha) through any information that the market already knows [5]. Under EMH (and the classic CAPM model), unpredictable one-off events like a CEO’s ill-advised tweet or personal scandal are treated as specific noise that cannot be systematically exploited for gain [5] [6]. In theory, investors should not be able to beat the market by anticipating such surprises and any temporary mispricing would quickly self-correct. However, practice shows that we see repeated evidence of short-term market inefficiencies when these surprises hit. As behavioral finance research shows, real markets are influenced by investor psychology, sentiment, and herd behavior, not just rational fundamentals [7]. Investors often don’t react until news is “official” even if rumors circulate which creates a brief window of mispricing. For example, one study found no leak or gradual adjustment before scandal news broke, but instead, investors would “wait for something more tangible before reacting”, causing a sudden drop once the media makes an announcement [3]. A study from the University of Sussex found that while corporate scandals caused a significant short-term drop in share prices, the companies often showed improved operating performance in the long run [3]. This indicates a research opportunity if an algorithm can detect and quantify such sentiment shocks early (from rumors, social media, etc.), it could adjust prices before the broader market fully reacts.

The dramatic market reactions to events like these underscores a critical gap in traditional financial modeling. While conventional analysis focuses on fundamentals, the 'human factor' remains an uncertain and poorly quantified variable. Therefore, this research addresses the central question: How can the impact of CEO-centric scandals and controversies on stock valuation be systematically measured? To answer this, the paper introduces CONTRA, a new framework designed to quantify these human factor shocks. The following sections will review existing literature, detail the CONTRA methodology, apply it to several case studies, and discuss the implications for risk management and investment theory.

## Literature Review

### 2.1 Shortcomings of Traditional Models
Classical models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) remain a fundamental baseline in asset-pricing research. CAPM assumes that expected returns depend solely on systematic market risk (beta), while firm-specific events are diversified away, as originally formalized by Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965). However, these assumptions—rational investors, informational efficiency, and homogeneous expectations—are increasingly challenged by contemporary empirical evidence.

Recent work highlights that behavioral factors and attention-driven mechanisms systematically distort price formation, generating predictable deviations from CAPM’s predictions. Ma et al. (2021) investigated the impact of market attention shocks on return variations, aiming to explain volatility in high-stress environments. Their analysis showed that investor sentiment and behavioral overreactions can explain significant return variations that CAPM leaves unexplained. Further, Sun et al. (2016) focused on high-frequency sentiment to test for return predictability. Their purpose was to determine if intraday sentiment shifts could forecast short-term price movements in the S&P 500. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset derived from news wires, social media, and earnings calls, they constructed a high-frequency sentiment index. They found that lagged half-hour sentiment scores significantly predict intraday returns, suggesting that behavioral factors and noise traders drive short-term market inefficiencies that traditional models fail to capture.

Newer multifactor and anomaly-driven analyses deepen this critique. A major replication study by Hou et al. (2020) evaluated more than 150 documented return predictors to test the robustness of market anomalies. Their comprehensive analysis confirmed that many anomalies persist even after controlling for market risk, contradicting CAPM’s core assumption that only beta should matter. More recently, Hirshleifer et al. (2020) explored the link between social sentiment and market volatility. They demonstrated that sentiment-driven mispricing contributes materially to excess volatility, particularly around high-attention or shock-driven events.

Critics of strict market-efficiency views argue that prices can stray far from fundamentals during sentiment-driven booms and panics. The 19 October 1987 “Black Monday” crash, when the Dow fell 22.6% in a single day, remains a significant example which challenges purely rational models. Collectively, this modern literature indicates that asset prices frequently diverge from fundamentals due to behavioral biases, sentiment spillovers, and rapid information cascades—patterns that classical equilibrium models cannot fully capture. Building on this perspective, our study treats these behavioral inefficiencies as measurable signals that can be incorporated into predictive modeling frameworks.

### 2.2 Impact of News and Scandals
A key part of the literature relevant to this work deals with event studies and how markets respond to news, both financial and personal. Wang et al. (2015) performed an event study analysis on 80 corporate scandals to measure the stock market's reaction to CEO misconduct. They found that while long-term performance recovered, the short-term impact on share price was sharply negative, regardless of whether the scandal was financial or personal; shares on average fell between 6% and 9% in the month after the CEO’s misconduct became public. This finding validates that investor sentiment and trust play a huge role; a breach of integrity or negative publicity can erase billions in market cap overnight.

Complementing this, Moat et al. (2013) investigated whether online information-seeking behavior precedes stock market movements. By analyzing Wikipedia pageview data for financial topics, they looked for correlations between attention spikes and price changes. Their findings revealed that increases in Wikipedia pageviews often preceded stock market falls, suggesting that investors seek information *before* making selling decisions. This supports the idea that online attention can serve as an "early warning" signal for the sentiment-alpha coefficient.

### 2.3 Social Media and Alternative Data
The use of social media and alternative data is one of the pillars in modern financial research. In a comprehensive study, Greyling and Rossouw (2025) analyzed nearly 3 million stock-related tweets to investigate the predictive power of social media sentiment. They employed machine learning classifiers (such as Naïve Bayes and SVM) to quantify traders' emotions and correlated these signals with market trends. They found that sentiment derived from the platform "strongly predicts market trends in both developed and emerging markets." They argue that quantifying traders' emotions can significantly enhance the prediction of intraday price fluctuations, an influence that traditional financial models, which assume investor rationality, tend to overlook.

### 2.4 AI and Sentiment Analysis in Trading
Recent advances in artificial intelligence have begun to bridge the gap between raw market data and the elusive “human factor” signals that move prices. Shobayo et al. (2024) compared the effectiveness of specialized financial language models (FinBERT) against general-purpose LLMs (GPT-4) and traditional statistical methods. By utilizing a dataset of financial news and headlines, they demonstrated that advanced LLMs and domain-specific models significantly outperform traditional logistic regression in predicting stock prices.

Chen et al. (2023) evaluated the capabilities of Generative AI models in parsing financial news. They fed a large corpus of news articles into ChatGPT and Deepseek to predict stock market direction. Their study found that ChatGPT was uniquely effective at extracting positive news signals that investors typically underreact to, consistent with behavioral underreaction theories.

Finally, Jha et al. (2023) applied an NLP model to over 74,000 earnings call transcripts to detect subtle cues in corporate leadership communications. They analyzed the text for nuanced changes in tone and phrasing. Their findings showed that the AI was able to read “between the lines,” flagging nuanced changes in tone that reliably foreshadowed concrete corporate decisions like increases in capital expenditures. This confirms that leadership sentiment is a quantifiable predictor of future company behavior.

**Summary and Research Gap**
Collectively, these studies illustrate a clear evolution in financial modeling: from rational equilibrium models (CAPM) to behavioral frameworks, and finally to AI-driven sentiment analysis. While existing research confirms that social media, news sentiment, and online attention individually impact stock prices, there is a lack of integrated frameworks that combine these diverse signals specifically to quantify the impact of CEO-centric controversies. Most current models focus on general market sentiment or financial news, often overlooking the specific volatility caused by leadership scandals. CONTRA addresses this gap by proposing a novel "sentiment-alpha" coefficient that synthesizes multi-source data (search trends, Wikipedia traffic, and social media) to systematically measure and predict the price shocks caused by the "human factor" in corporate leadership.
